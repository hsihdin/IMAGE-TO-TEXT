# Image to Text Conversion using DenseNet and Tokenizer

![Project Banner](project_banner.png)

## Overview

This project aims to convert images into text using the powerful combination of DenseNet, a deep convolutional neural network, and a tokenizer for natural language processing. 
By leveraging the features learned by DenseNet from the images, we can generate meaningful textual descriptions, enabling applications such as image captioning, accessibility enhancements, and more.

## Features

- State-of-the-art image-to-text conversion using DenseNet and a tokenizer.
- Seamless integration of image preprocessing, feature extraction, and text generation.
- Customizable parameters to fine-tune the model according to specific requirements.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick image-to-text conversion.

## Installation
